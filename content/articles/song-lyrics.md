Have you ever listened to a song and thought, "Wow, I really like this song!".
You might like it for the flow, the instruments, the beat, the lyrics, or even the artist.
Regardless of why you found the song interesting, 
it eventually makes its way into your playlist where you listen to it quite often.

One thing I found incredibly interesting after talking to people about their music tastes is the way they listen to music. From everyone I've talked to, there are two types of people:

People who listen to song lyrics, and those who don't. Coming from the side that listens to song lyrics, I find it important to be able to at least understand some parts of the song. Knowing what the artist is singing about adds flavour to a dish, similar to how Michelin Star restaurants give detail into the food they serve to you. Even if the lyrics have no particular meaning to me, I find comfort in being able to sing to parts of the song without butchering it up.

I also do see the other side, knowing the lyrics does not diminish the value of music. Some songs are great and even if the lyrics are repetitive or "bad", it doesn't matter because it doesn't really matter in the end.

Anyways, I'm writing this post becuase I want to record song lyrics that I find lyrically and musically amazing. Something about the way it's presented resonates with me - and I would like to share it with my readers. Hope you enjoy!
