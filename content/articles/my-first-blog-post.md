# Welcome to My Blog!

Hey guys, this is my first blog post of 2021. I hope to update this weekly (or maybe even daily) as long as interesting things happen in my life. I will most likely post a lot initially so it looks presentable, and then slow it down afterwards.

**On another note**, I've never really used markdown on a regular basis so this is the perfect opportunity to practice:

### Cool features I will be using in my blog posts:

* **Bolded stuff**
* *Italicized stuff*
* `code` 
* [A link](https://zhehaizhang.com/blog)

```js[nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  nuxt: "is the best"
}
```
```html[my-first-blog-post.md]
<p>code styling is easy</p>
```
